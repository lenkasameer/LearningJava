An interface is a collection of abstract methods and constant class variables, i.e. final static fields. Since Shape does not have any concrete parts to it now, it can be represented in the form of an interface as shown below:

public interface Shape {
   // abstract methods
   abstract float area();
   abstract float perimeter();
}


The syntax to use the Shape interface in a program is as follows:

public class Rectangle implements Shape {
   // class definition for Rectangle
}


Just like an abstract class, an interface cannot be instantiated. Java allows a class to implement more than one interface. The syntax for implementing more than one interface is

public class MyClass implements Interface1, Interface2, Interface3…


Also, as you know, Java does not allow a class to extend multiple classes, but an interface can extend multiple interfaces. The syntax for extending multiple interfaces is

public interface MyInterface extends Interface1, Interface2, Interface3…


You need to use the extends keyword once, followed by the comma-separated list of interfaces that you wish to extend.
