A LinkedList is another data structure in Java that works like ArrayList, with similar methods
and functionalities.



However, there is a difference in the structure. The elements are not stored in contiguous memory
locations. This affects programs from a performance perspective, i.e. even though the outputs of all the operations are the same, the speeds are different.



For the time being, let’s focus on just the operations of both ArrayList and LinkedList.


All the three methods—add, remove, and contains—work the same way in a LinkedList.
Now, let’s look at another method to access an element from a list using its index.
